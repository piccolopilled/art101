				<p>I was having trouble formatting the JavaScript code for this lab, but I eventually figured it out. I figured out the main issue through WesBot, which was that the server didn't have CORS headers, blocking my website from pulling data from the JSON. I used a proxy link to the JSON that was sent in the Discord server, and I was able to get my code running. Another random issue I had was that my JavaScript file wasn't loading properly, and it was because I had accidentally named my JavaScript folder as "lab.js" instead of "js." It's really interesting how the tiniest things can be the root of the problem in coding, but I enjoy the process of coding and it's satisfying to locate errors.</p>
