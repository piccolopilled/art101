				<p>I didn't have much trouble in the debugging process! I found this lab very satisfying because it reflects how much I've learned over the past couple weeks and how much more familiar I am with JavaScript and jQuery.</p>

				<p>For this lab, the output was not printing correctly. In the past, I was having trouble using JavaScript to print the output, using commands like document.writeln(). I find that using jQuery makes things a little easier and faster, so I edited the code using jQuery to print the output in a div#output, displaying a greeting message followed by the returned results of the function sortUsername().</p>
				<h3>Lab 12 Debug</h3>
				<p>This one is less of a debug and more of a feature I wanted to add but didn't quite figure out how, so I went back to the script and added different sets of images which would be appended to the output div depending on the condition.</p>
